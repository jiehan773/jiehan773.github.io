<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>My name is Jie Han (韩杰, 韓傑 in traditional Chinese). I am a tenure-track assistant professor in Department of Mathematics, University of Rhode Island, RI, USA. I am a member of the discrete math group. My research is partially supported by Simons Collaboration Grant for Mathematicians.</p>

<p>Before moving (back) to the US, I was a postdoc research fellow at the Universidade de Sao Paulo (USP) working with Prof. Yoshiharu Kohayakawa from March 2015 to August 2018 and a visiting research fellow of the University of Birmingham in the academic year 2015 - 2016. 
I stayed at IMA (the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications, Minneapolis, MN) in Fall 2014. I finished my Ph. D. in Georgia State University (GSU) (2010 - 2015) under the supervision of Prof. Yi Zhao. I finished my B. S. in Beijing Institute of Technology (2004 - 2008). </p>
