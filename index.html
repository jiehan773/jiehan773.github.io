<p> Selected Papers </p>
<ul>
  <li>Non-linear Hamilton cycles in linear quasi-random hypergraphs, with Xichao Shu and Guanghui Wang. SODA '21. We solve a problem of Lenz,
   Mubayi and Mycroft, showing that given l<k such that k-l does not divide k, linear quasi-randomness together with a minimum (l+1)-degree condition 
                                              guarantees Hamilton l-cycles in k-uniform hypergraphs, while a similar minimum l-degree does not suffice.</li>
  <li>On Perfect Matchings in k-complexes, IMRN, to appear. We give new proofs of several characterization theorems for the existence of 
    perfect matchings in dense simplicial complexes by Keevash and Mycroft [Mem. AMS, 2015]. In particular, our proof avoids the use of 
    the hypergraph regularity lemma and the hypergraph blow-up lemma. Instead, we use the lattice-based absorbing method developed 
    by Han and a recent probabilistic argument of Kohayakawa, Person and Han.</li>
  <li>Decision problem for Perfect Matchings in Dense k-uniform Hypergraphs, Trans. AMS, 369-7(2017), 5197-5218. We show that the decision 
    problem for the containment of perfect matchings in k-uniform hypergraphs with minimum codegree at least n/k can be solved in polynomial time. 
    This solves a problem of Karpinski, Rucinski and Szymanska completely and improves the work of Keevash, Knox and Mycroft.</li>
